                <p>Depending on the manufacturer, your sewing machine's model number may be located in one of the following places:</p>
                <ul class="list-disc pl-6">
                    <li><strong>Front or Side of the Machine</strong> ‚Äì Many brands place a metal plate or sticker with the model number on the front or side of the machine.</li>
                    <li><strong>Underneath the Machine</strong> ‚Äì Some machines have a sticker on the bottom, which may require tilting the unit slightly to see.</li>
                    <li><strong>Inside the Bobbin Case Area</strong> ‚Äì For machines with a front-loading bobbin, the model number might be inside the bobbin compartment.</li>
                    <li><strong>Near the Handwheel or Motor Area</strong> ‚Äì Some models list the serial number and model number near the power cord or on the back panel.</li>

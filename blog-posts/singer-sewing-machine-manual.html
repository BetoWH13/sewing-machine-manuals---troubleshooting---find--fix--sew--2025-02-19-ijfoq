            <ul class="list-none mb-6">

                <li class="mb-2">‚úÖ <strong>Skipped Stitches</strong> ‚Äì Ensure you are using the correct needle type and replace if necessary. Adjust the thread tension and test on scrap fabric.</li>
                <li class="mb-2">‚úÖ <strong>Machine Not Sewing</strong> ‚Äì Make sure the presser foot is down and the feed dogs are engaged. Also, check if the bobbin winder is in the correct position.</li>
